    "The MIT bag model, which has commonly been applied to strange quark stars, relates pressure to energy density with the simple equation of state $p=\\frac{\\epsilon}{3}-\\frac{4B}{3}$. There is only one parameter, the \"bag constant\" $B$. This represents the vacuum energy density, which creates a \"bag\" in which quarks are confined. See [Chodos et al.
